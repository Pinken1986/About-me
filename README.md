# About-me
My love for crafting code is undeniable. Even though I'm new to programming and face challenges with dyslexia, learning disabilities, and autism, it's more than just a hobby for me.  Coding is my escape. Solving problems and creating through code creates a flow state, a deep concentration that helps manage my anxiety and depression.
