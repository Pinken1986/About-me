My love for crafting code is undeniable. Even though I'm new to programming and face challenges with dyslexia, learning disabilities, and autism, it's more than just a hobby for me.

Coding is my escape. Solving problems and creating through code creates a flow state, a deep concentration that helps manage my anxiety and depression.

One of my favorite ways to explore this passion is through modding Minecraft. Learning a new language like Java isn't always easy, but the satisfaction of seeing my customizations come to life fuels my determination to keep learning and creating.
